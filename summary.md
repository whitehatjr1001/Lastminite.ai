# Project Checkpoint Summary

_Last updated: 2025-09-25_

## Supervisor & Routing Layer
- Replaced heuristic routing with an LLM-driven supervisor that emits structured decisions (`SupervisorDecision`).
- Added explicit handoff instructions so sub-agents receive context-aware prompts (quick search, deep research, image generation, simple answers).
- Implemented granular logging (emoji-coloured) covering inputs, routing rationale, and worker activity.
- Expanded prompts to cover router, simple answers, quick search synthesis, deep research briefs, and image scaffolding.

## Worker Agents
- Quick search now integrates Tavily HTTPS calls with fallback to direct answers and logs snippet counts.
- Deep research delegates to the MCP agent using a supervisor-curated brief.
- Image generation uses the Nano Banana OpenAI client, handles safety errors gracefully, and returns data-URI images.

## Service Layer
- `run_revision_agent` wraps the LangGraph graph, normalises state objects, and exposes sync/async entry points.
- Added `summarise_agent_result` for UI-friendly outputs and `configure_agent_logging` for unified logging config.

## UI & Examples
- Created Chainlit UI (`interface/chainlit_ui.py`) supporting session history, image rendering, and detailed terminal logs.
- Added `examples/supervisor_service_demo.py` to exercise the pipeline end-to-end with logging enabled.

## Supporting Updates
- Updated project dependencies (`requests` for Tavily integration).
- Added `summary.md` as a checkpoint record; previous TODOs and logging utilities refined accordingly.

## Next Steps
- Expand automated tests for supervisor routing and worker fallbacks.
- Plug in authenticated Tavily/MCP credentials for production use.
- Iterate on UI/UX (e.g., streaming responses, richer metadata panels).
